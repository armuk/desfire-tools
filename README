Some tools for the NXP Mifare DESfire card that I find myself needing.

Until now only mifare-desfire-analyze is in here. Its mission is to
find out as much as possible about a presented DESfire card (permissions,
AIDs, files, keys) and print it. Some of the information may be
willingly given out by the card, some of it can be brute-forced.
